# My attempt at learning the basics of Javascript and Html Canvas

My goal is to have a rudimental, functioning Pong Game

Check it out at https://marcoboncoraglio.github.io/jsPong/

## TO DO:

  * Hitboxes are very buggy
  * System to keep track of score
  * Background music?
  * Help button for how to play the game
  * Game modes (1 player mode or 2 player mode) (Building the AI)
