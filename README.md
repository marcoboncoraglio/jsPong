# My attempt at learning the basics of Javascript and Game Theory

My goal is to have a rudimental, functioning Pong Game

## TO DO:

  * When the balls goes out of bounds instantly continue (no time to prepare for next point)
  * Hitboxes are very buggy
  * Sound effects for scoring(cheering maybe?)
  * System to keep track of score
  * Background music?
  * Help button for how to play the game
  * Game modes (1 player mode or 2 player mode) (Building the AI)
